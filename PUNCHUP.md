** Portfolio Punch Up! **

---

Punch-up Description:
A screen where users can select from curated playlists to play as they navigate through my website. The screen would have album pictures lined up and stacked over each other, and when clicked would come to the top and display text with highlight tracks from it, and a button that would start that music on loop for the website.

How it will enhacnce my work:
As an avid music lover, this would help tie in my personality with my portfolio in a way that stands out. It would allow me to practice my animations and better understand them, beyond standard css transistions/hover states. It would also allow me to add more interactivity and personalization to my website, with users having the choice of what music to listen to, or not listen at all.

Fears, concerns, or doubts about implementation:
Having only linked music via Spotify's embed feature before, I am concerned for how I would go about sourcing/storing the music required.

I also am concerned for the integrity of the site, if the files needed will bog down the runtime and lag it.
